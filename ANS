Which of the following physical security systems allows only one person inside and requests an identity; if the identity is invalid, the person is held inside until a security professional arrives?
Walkthrough detectors
X-ray inspection systems
Metal detectors
 Mantrap systems 
The physical security system that allows only one person inside and requests an identity; if the identity is invalid, the person is held inside until a security professional arrives is called a "mantrap system".

A mantrap system is a physical security control that is designed to control access to a secure area by ensuring that only one person at a time is permitted to enter or exit. It usually consists of two doors or gates, which can be electronically controlled, that are separated by a small, secure space.

When a person approaches the mantrap, the first door opens and they are allowed to enter the secure space. They are then required to provide some form of identity, such as a smart card or biometric information, to gain access through the second door. If the identity is valid, the second door will open, and the person is allowed to enter the secure area. If the identity is invalid, the second door will remain locked, and the person is held inside until a security professional arrives.

Walkthrough detectors, X-ray inspection systems, and metal detectors are types of screening systems used for detecting weapons, explosives, and other prohibited items. They are typically used at entrances to secure areas, such as airports, government buildings, and courthouses, to screen individuals and their belongings for potential security threats.

Kristen deploys firewall in his organization that works at the session layer of the OSI model and monitors the TCP handshake between hosts to determine whether a requested session is legitimate or not. Identify the firewall technology implemented here.
 Circuit-level gateways 
Stateful multilayer inspection firewall
Application-level gateways
Application proxy
The firewall technology implemented by Kristen that works at the session layer of the OSI model and monitors the TCP handshake between hosts to determine whether a requested session is legitimate or not is called "circuit-level gateways".

Circuit-level gateways, also known as circuit-level proxies, operate at the session layer of the OSI model and monitor the TCP handshake between hosts to determine whether a requested session is legitimate or not. They do not inspect the contents of the packets, but instead verify that the connection is allowed based on the state of the session.

When a client initiates a connection with a server, the circuit-level gateway intercepts the request and performs a TCP handshake with the server on behalf of the client. If the handshake is successful, the circuit-level gateway opens a temporary "circuit" between the client and server, allowing them to communicate directly with each other. The circuit-level gateway then monitors the session for its duration to ensure that no unauthorized activity takes place.

Compared to other types of firewalls, such as stateful multilayer inspection firewalls, application-level gateways, and application proxies, circuit-level gateways provide a faster and more efficient way of securing network connections. However, they offer less granular control and do not provide detailed inspection of the application layer protocols.

Which of the following cloud deployments is a dynamic heterogeneous environment that combines workloads across various cloud vendors and is managed via one proprietary interface to achieve long-term business goals?
Public cloud
Multi cloud
Private cloud
Community cloud
The cloud deployment that is a dynamic heterogeneous environment that combines workloads across various cloud vendors and is managed via one proprietary interface to achieve long-term business goals is called a "multi cloud".

A multi cloud deployment involves using multiple cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, to meet different business needs. By using a multi cloud approach, organizations can avoid vendor lock-in, reduce risk, and optimize costs.

In a multi cloud deployment, workloads are spread across different cloud providers and managed via a single interface. This can be achieved through the use of cloud management platforms (CMPs), which provide a centralized view of all the resources and workloads across the different cloud providers. CMPs enable organizations to manage and monitor their cloud resources and workloads, as well as automate processes and enforce policies.

Overall, a multi cloud deployment provides greater flexibility, agility, and resilience than a single cloud deployment, and enables organizations to take advantage of the strengths of different cloud providers to meet their specific business needs.




 
Finch segregated the LAN creating an independent subnetwork that has been placed between organization’s internal network and outside public network to enable high-level protection for LAN. Identify the independent network created to protect the LAN.
Honeypot
Proxy server
DMZ
VLAN
The independent subnetwork created to protect the LAN is called a DMZ (demilitarized zone).

A DMZ is a network segment that is placed between an organization's internal network and an external public network, such as the Internet. It is designed to provide an additional layer of security by isolating publicly accessible servers and services from the internal network, while still allowing controlled access to those resources.

In a DMZ, publicly accessible servers, such as web servers and email servers, are placed in the DMZ segment and are isolated from the internal network. Access to these servers is controlled through a firewall, which allows only authorized traffic to pass through.

By segregating publicly accessible servers and services into a DMZ, an organization can reduce the risk of attacks and minimize the potential damage that a successful attack could cause.
